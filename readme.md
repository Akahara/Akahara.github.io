### Acalais.fr

That's my website ! See it at [acalais.fr](https://acalais.fr)

I *tried* to follow clean-web principles, its probably a bit heavy because images are the most important part of the website.

- HTML files in `documentation/` are generated using [markdown-to-html](https://github.com/Akahara/markdown-to-html).
- The index is also generated from markdown files using [pages.py](pages.py).
- Images are reduced using the [reduce_images.py](reduce_images.py) script.
